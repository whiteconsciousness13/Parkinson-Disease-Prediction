# Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict Parkinson’s Disease based on vocal biomarkers. Implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, the project explores multiple classification algorithms to accurately detect the disease from voice measurements.

## Project Highlights

- Implemented multiple ML models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) for disease classification.
- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing and noisy data.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and compare classification accuracy.
- Achieved **95% accuracy** with SVM.
- Visualized model performance using ROC curves, box plots, and confusion matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of vocal measurements collected from individuals, including those diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease and healthy controls. The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
